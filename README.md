At LEXA, our vision is to advance the understanding of ancient technologies and behaviours 
through scientific experiments to generate and test archaeological hypotheses. Our work 
spans both open-air and controlled laboratory conditions to generate reference collections 
for archaeological comparative studies.

Our mission

At LEXA, we strive to:

- Develop experiments to test and refine archaeological hypotheses.
- Perform experiments in a wide range of ancient behaviours, centred on the prehistoric material culture, anthropogenic actions, as well as biogenic and geogenic site formation processes.
- Produce, increase, and enrich reference collections for comparative studies.
- Publish detailed reports on experimental protocols to ensure variable control, reproducibility, and replicability.
- Embrace open science and FAIR principles of scientific research.
- Develop new experimental archaeological outreach initiatives that reach a wide audience./impact of fire across several archaeological contexts and materials.
